This project, not sorted but only uploded only code files.
I built a website that works on PHP, SQL, Server-side, JavaScript, and Html + CSS. The site is for comparison between devices. All data on every device took from tables in the SQL server. The data is inserted by the admin. Also, the admin could change details as he could show the data of every device on his section's screen. Additionally, every user could save the comparison, and download the details of a device he prefers, to a pdf file.
